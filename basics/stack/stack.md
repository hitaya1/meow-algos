A **stack** is an abstract data type that serves
as a collection of elements, with two principal operations:

* **push**, which adds an element to the collection, and
* **pop**, which removes the most recently added element that was not yet removed.

LIFO (last in, first out)
A peek operation may give access to the top without modifying
the stack.
