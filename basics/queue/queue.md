A **queue** is a particular kind of abstract data
type or collection in which the entities in the collection are
kept in order.
The principle (or only) operations on the
collection: the addition of entities to the rear terminal
position, known as enqueue, and removal of entities from the
front terminal position, known as dequeue.
Queue  is a First-In-First-Out (FIFO) linear (a sequential
collection) data structure.

A peek or front operation returns the value of the front element
without dequeuing it.
